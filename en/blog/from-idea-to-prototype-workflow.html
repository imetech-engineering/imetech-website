          <div class="blog-intro">
            <p class="lead">
              After years of product development, I've learned that <strong>every engineer has their own workflow</strong>. What works for one person doesn't necessarily work for another. In this article, I share my personal approach: how I go from an initial idea to a working prototype, including all the pitfalls, shortcuts, and lessons I've learned along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn't a theoretical guide, but a practical behind-the-scenes look at how I approach projects. From the first sketch on a napkin to the moment a prototype actually works. Here is my complete workflow, with all the ups and downs that come with it.

          <!-- 1. The first 24 hours: from idea to action -->
          <section class="blog-section">
            <h2>The first 24 hours: from idea to action</h2>
            <p>
              The moment you get an idea is magical, but it's also dangerous. Too many people get stuck in the "what if" phase and never take action. My rule is simple: <strong>within 24 hours, I must have something tangible</strong>. That could be a sketch, a breadboard, or just a list of questions I need to answer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why 24 hours? Because after that time, enthusiasm fades and you start to doubt. By acting quickly, you create momentum and prevent your idea from disappearing into the "I'll do this someday" category. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just needs to exist.
            </p>

                <p>Write down everything you know. Make a sketch, note assumptions, and ask yourself: "What's the smallest thing I can make to test this?"</p>

                <p>Build something, no matter how simple. A breadboard, a 3D print, or just a cardboard mockup. It must physically exist, not just in your head.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>
              <strong>My golden rule:</strong> If I'm still enthusiastic about the idea after 24 hours, then it's worth continuing. If not, I let it go and move on to the next idea. There are plenty of good ideas, the problem is that we take too little action.

          <section class="blog-section">
            <h2>Week 1: The reality check</h2>
            <p>
              After those first 24 hours comes the reality check. Now I need to be honest with myself: is this idea really worth it? I have a simple test: <strong>can I explain the problem in one sentence to my mother or girlfriend?</strong> If they don't understand it, then it's too complex or too vague.
            </p>
            <p>
              This week is crucial because this is where most projects die. You discover that the problem isn't as big as you thought, or that a good solution already exists, or that you simply don't have the right skills. That's okay, better now than after months of work.

            <p>
              Now the real work begins. I order components, grab my breadboard, and start building. This is my favorite phase, here I see my idea come to life for the first time. But it's also the phase where I make the most mistakes.

            <p>
              My approach is simple: <strong>build the dumbest prototype that still works</strong>. No nice housing, no perfect code, no elegant solutions. Just something that proves the concept works. If it doesn't work, then I know I need to go back to the drawing board.

            <h2>Month 2: The first big mistake</h2>
            <p>
              This always happens: your first prototype works, you're proud, and then you make the classic mistake. You think: "Now I'm going to make it beautiful." You order a PCB, you design a housing, you write beautiful code. And then you discover that you've overlooked something fundamental.
            </p>
            <p>
              My biggest mistake? I had built a sensor that worked perfectly in the office, but once in a housing in practical use, it turned out that certain chosen components couldn't handle the temperatures they encountered in practice. This led to sensor deviations.

            <p>
              After the first mistake comes reality: product development is hard work. You have to iterate, test, adjust, and start over. This is where most people give up, but this is also where the real work happens. Here you learn what your product really is, not what you think it is.

            <p>
              This is the question I get most often: "When is my prototype ready?" The answer is simple: <strong>a prototype is never ready</strong>. It's always a work in progress, always improvable, always imperfect. But there comes a moment when you have to stop iterating and start the next project.

              <strong>My rule:</strong> If your prototype meets these four criteria, then it's ready. Not perfect, not production-ready, but ready enough to move on to the next project. Perfection is the enemy of progress.

            <h2>Conclusion: My workflow isn't perfect, and that's okay</h2>
            <p>
              This is my workflow, but it's not perfect. I still make mistakes, I still doubt, and I still give up on projects that don't work. And that's okay. Product development isn't an exact science, it's a process of trial and error, of learning and adapting.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most important thing I've learned is that there's no perfect workflow. What works for me might not work for you. What works for one project might not work for another. The art is to develop your own workflow, based on your own experiences and lessons.
            </p>
            <p>
              Start small, test early, learn fast, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Every mistake is a lesson, every lesson makes you better, and every improvement brings you closer to a product that people really want to use. That's my workflow, and it works for me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Do you have an idea for a product or want help developing your own workflow? Feel free to get in touch. I'd be happy to help you realize your idea, from initial concept to working prototype. And who knows, maybe I'll learn something from you too.
